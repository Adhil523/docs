# Running in production
Numary is currently in beta. During this evaluation phase:
* Breaking changes can happen between releases
* Critical bugs can be discovered
* Documentation will be incomplete

The next phase beyond beta is RC. The RC will officially freeze the 1.x line API and the 1.x will mark the start of the 1 year support period.
