# Installation

Interested in trying Numary Ledger out? You will need to install it on your local machine first. 

Numary Ledger is, as you'd expect, available for Linux, macOS, and Windows. 

We also provide Docker images for production environments. You can learn more about all the different ways of installing Numary Ledger in the [reference documentation](/oss/ledger/reference/installation).

## macOS
<HomebrewInstall />

## Linux

Numary Ledger is available for APT (Debian) and RPM (RedHat) based distributions.

### Install with APT (Debian, Ubuntu)
<APTInstall />

### Install with RPM (RedHat, Fedora, SUSE)

<RPMInstall />

## Windows

[Download the pre-compiled binary ` numary_x.y.z_Windows-64bit.zip`](https://github.com/numary/ledger/releases) from GitHub (where `x.y.z` is the version number). Unzip the file, and place `numary.exe` somewhere convenient such as `C:\Program Files`.

:::info
Consider renaming the executable `numary` (without the `.exe` suffix) to make it easier to type, and so the example commands in the rest of the tutorial will work without having to edit them.

## Troubleshooting

You can check that Numary CLI was installed correctly by trying the following command:

```shell
# check your installation
numary version
```
