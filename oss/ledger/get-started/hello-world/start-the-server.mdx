# Start the Numary Ledger service

:::info
Numary Ledger is a service that must be running before it can process any transactions.
:::

To start the Numary Ledger service, enter the following into your command line:

```shell
numary server start --verbose
```

TODO THIS IS ALL A LIE. need to make it not a lie.

If all is well, you should see something like this in your shell:
```
Version: 1.0.0-rc3 
Date: 2022-01-27T10:53:14Z 
Commit: 266c79e 
running... 
```

## Troubleshooting

Seeing something else instead? Or nothing at all?

If the numary server just exits without a message, then you are probably already running an instance of the server somewhere else.

## Next steps

Next up, let's introduce money into our system so we can start moving it around.
