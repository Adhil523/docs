Are you building an app that requires tracking the movement of money? Then you need a ledger. Numary Ledger is designed to simplify the process of integrating ledger functionality into your app or backend.

Here, we'll help you get started with setting up Numary Ledger and executing your first transactions.

<!-- a happy graphic here! -->

If you've never used Numary Ledger before, then start by [installing Ledger](installation), and run through the [Hello World guide](hello-world) to create your first transaction.

Then, once you're comfortable with the basics, move on to the [guides](/oss/ledger/guides/) to learn about the different use cases and functionality that Numary Ledger supports.
