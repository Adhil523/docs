title: Overdrafts

import { NumscriptBlock } from 'react-numscript-codeblock';

In the introductory tutorial, we used `@world` as the default account to source funds into our ledger. The built-in world account is a good and simple way of representing the outside world in the abstract, and can help reduce complexity in your ledger by providing a single point of contact for all funds being created or destroyed. In real-life, however, it is sometimes useful to be able to make some internal balances go negative. This is where the concept of overdraft comes in.

## When to use overdraft

Overdraft is a feature that allows you to represent a balance that can go negative, with fine-grained control over how much it can go negative. It is usually useful in the following cases:

* You want to keep track of indidual users and sub-accounts debts, e.g. a user of you fintech app with a credit line or a marketplace merchant
* You want to represent transactions with funds being sourced from specific external accounts, e.g. an external bank account or payment processor balance

## Using overdraft

<NumscriptBlock script={`send [USD/2 500] (
  source = {
    @users:42:main
    @users:42:overdraft allowing overdraft up to [USD/2 200]
    @users:42:credit allowing overdraft up to [USD/2 1000]
  }
  destination = @users:100
)`}></NumscriptBlock>


:::info
Accounts overdraft capability is, as of now, only available in Numscript-modeled transactions.

## Pulling limit from account

It is possible to use metadata variable injection to pull the overdraft limit directly from the account we are using in transaction.

<NumscriptBlock script={`vars {
  monetary $limit = meta(@users:42, "overdraft_limit")
}\n
send [USD/2 500] (
  source = {
    @users:42:main
    @users:42:overdraft allowing overdraft up to $limit
  }
  destination = @users:100
)`}></NumscriptBlock>

In such case, we would need to set the `overdraft_limit` metadata variable on the account first, according to the format described in the detailed [metadata](/ledger/reference/numscript/metadata) section.

```json
  {
    "coupon_value": {
      "type": "monetary",
      "value": {
        "amount": 100,
        "asset": "USD"
      }
    }
  }
  ```
