# Installation

Interested in trying Formance Ledger out? The best way is to create a cloud sandbox using the Formance CLI.

Formance CLI is a command-line tool for creating and managing Ledger instances in the cloud. And, as you'd expect, it's available for Linux, macOS, and Windows.

You can learn more about all the different ways of installing Formance Ledger in the [reference documentation](/ledger/operations/installation).

## macOS
<HomebrewInstall />

## Linux

Formance CLI is available for APT (Debian) and RPM (RedHat) based distributions.

### Install with APT (Debian, Ubuntu)
<APTInstall />

### Install with RPM (RedHat, Fedora, SUSE)

<RPMInstall />

## Windows

[Download the pre-compiled binary ` numary_x.y.z_Windows-64bit.zip`](https://github.com/formancehq/ledger/releases) from GitHub (where `x.y.z` is the version number). Unzip the file, and place `numary.exe` somewhere convenient such as `C:\Program Files`.

:::info
Consider renaming the executable `numary` (without the `.exe` suffix) to make it easier to type, and so the example commands in the rest of the tutorial will work without having to edit them.

## Docker

<DockerInstall />

## Troubleshooting

You can check that Formance CLI was installed correctly by trying the following command:

```shell
fctl version
```

You should see something like

```
Version | 0.4.2
Date    | 2022-11-14T11:09:43Z
Commit  | 9fe16ac
```

If you don't, then recheck the steps above, or [reach out to us](ledger/help) to ask for help.


## Logging In

Finally, you'll need to either log into or create your Formance Cloud account. You can do that from the CLI:

```shell
fctl login
```

This will take you to a page for creating an account or logging in to your existing account.
