# Using the Control Dashboard
Formance Ledger ships with a minimal [dashboard](https://github.com/formancehq/control) that lets you easily see transactions and accounts in your ledgers.

It is conveniently hosted at [control.formance.com](https://control.formance.com/) for easy access - and also integrated into the formance binary, to be started with a simple `numary ui`.
