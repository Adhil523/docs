# Formance Wallets

Wallets is a fully managed white-label wallets microservice to debit and credit users funds and liabilities, with support for multi-currency wallets, reserved funds, temporary holds and fungibles expirations capabilities. It is built on top of the Formance Ledger and is designed to provide an easy way to get started with adding wallets capabilities to your application without having to worry about the underlying transactions structure.
