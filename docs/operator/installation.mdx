The deployment of resources is orchestrated by the Formance Kubernetes Operator, which is driven by the CRDs present in the Kubernetes Cluster and reconciles them against the current state of the cluster.

This essentially means that the operator will be creating and maintaining pods, services, and other resources on your cluster on your behalf. It is also the last mile of this setup guide before you get to actually use your Formance Stack â€” let's get started!

## Setup

You install the Formance Operator using Helm. If you don't have Helm installed, you can follow the [official Helm installation guide](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/).

You can deploy our Formance Operator using Helm:

```bash
helm install regions oci://ghcr.io/formancehq/helm/regions \
--version v2.0.0-rc.12 \
--namespace formance-system \
--create-namespace
```

Due to a limitation of Helm, the Versions CRD cannot be created at the same time as the installation of the Operator. You must launch an upgrade of the operator for this with the following command:
```bash
helm upgrade regions oci://ghcr.io/formancehq/helm/regions \
--version v2.0.0-rc.12 \
--namespace formance-system \
--create-namespace
```
