### NATS (optional)

_Version 2.6 or higher with Jetstream is required._

The recommended way to spin up a NATS deployment is through the official NATS helm [chart](https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/nats/nats).

:::info
Depending on your setup, you may need to activate Jetsream mode on your NATS deployment manually. Jetstream is required for the resources deployed by the Formance Operator to function properly.
