### Temporal (optional)

:::info
Using Temporal is only required for stacks using the flows service. It can be ommitted now if you don't plan on using it yet, and added at a later time.
:::

The recommended way to spin up a Temporal deployment is through Temporal Cloud, or by using the official Temporal helm [chart](https://github.com/temporalio/helm-charts).
