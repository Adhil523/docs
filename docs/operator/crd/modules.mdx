title: Modules
---
The operator is completely modular in its usage. Each Module brings a different set of features and can be enabled or disabled as needed.
We will create together the first Kubernetes objects to deploy the modules of your choice.

## Define Stack Object
The first object that needs to be created is the Stack object. This allows linking the different modules and deploying them together.


:::info
You can find all the available parameters in [the comprehensive CRD documentation](/next/operator/crd#stack).
:::

```yaml
apiVersion: formance.com/v1beta1
kind: Stack
metadata:
  name: formance-dev
spec:
  versionsFromFile: v2.0
```

During the deployment of the Operator and for its future upgrades, the Versions files are automatically updated following the semver pattern.
It is possible to specify a specific version by using the `versionFromFile` field in the Stack file.

## Define Gateway Object
The Gateway's role is to centralize all incoming connections to your stack. If you need to expose your Stack to the outside, it is necessary to route all the traffic through it.

:::info
You can find all the available parameters in [the comprehensive CRD documentation](/next/operator/crd#gateway).
:::

```yaml
apiVersion: formance.com/v1beta1
kind: Gateway
metadata:
  name: formance-dev
spec:
  stack: formance-dev
```

## Define Ledger Object
The second object that needs to be created is the Ledger object. This allows to define the different modules that will be deployed.


:::info
You can find all the available parameters in [the comprehensive CRD documentation](/next/operator/crd#ledger).
:::

```yaml
apiVersion: formance.com/v1beta1
kind: Ledger
metadata:
  name: formance-dev
spec:
  stack: formance-dev
```

If you wish to activate another Module on your Stack, you must follow the same pattern.
