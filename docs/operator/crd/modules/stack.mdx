## Stack Object
The first object that needs to be created is the Stack object. This allows linking the different modules and deploying them together.


:::info
You can find all the available parameters in [the comprehensive CRD documentation](/next/operator/crd#stack).
:::

```yaml
apiVersion: formance.com/v1beta1
kind: Stack
metadata:
  name: formance-dev
spec:
  versionsFromFile: v2.0
```

During the deployment of the Operator and for its future upgrades, the Versions files are automatically updated following the semver pattern.
It is possible to specify a specific version by using the `versionFromFile` field in the Stack file.
