# Configure OpenTelemetry

## Overview

Formance uses OpenTelemetry to collect and send telemetry data to your monitoring system. [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) is an open-source observability framework for cloud-native software. It provides a single set of APIs, libraries, agents, and instrumentation to capture distributed traces and metrics from your application.

## Configuration

### Prerequisites

This guide assume that you already have an OpenTelemetry server running and that you have the necessary credentials to connect to it.

### Configuration

In this example, we will set up an OpenTelemetry configuration for the `formance-dev` stack. This configuration will apply to all the modules of this stack.

```yaml
apiVersion: formance.com/v1beta1
kind: OpenTelemetryConfiguration
metadata:
  labels:
    formance.com/stack: formance-dev
  name: formance-dev-otel
spec:
  traces:
    otlp:
      endpoint: otel-collector-opentelemetry-collector.formance.svc.cluster.local
      insecure: true
      mode: grpc
      port: 4317
```

:::info
If you want to apply the configuration to all of your stacks, you can set the `formance.com/stack` label to `any`.
