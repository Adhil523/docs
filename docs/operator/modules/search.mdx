## Overview

Formance Search is a service that provides a search engine for your Formance stack. It is based on Elasticsearch and provides a powerful search engine for your data.

Search comes with with two components:
- **Search**: The public search service itself used to search your data.
- **[Benthos](https://www.benthos.dev/)**: The data pipeline that indexes your data into the search engine.

Benthos is a stream processor that is used to ingest data from your Formance stack into the Eleasticsearch search engine. Benthos listens to the [messages broker](/next/operator/infra/broker), transforms the data and indexes it into the search engine.

When you install the Search module with the Formance Operator, it will automatically install and configure Benthos on your behalf.
