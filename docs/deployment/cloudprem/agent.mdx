title: Agent Deployment
---
The agent allows linking your Kubernetes Cluster to your Formance Organization. To do this, you need to add an agent to your cluster that will manage the Operator through the CRDs.

## Requirements

Before you can link your Kubernetes cluster to a private Formance region. You must deploy [the Operator following this documentation](./../../operator/installation/deployments).

Now that the Operator is deployed, we'll activate the agent that will communicate with Formance Cloud. The agent is a component that runs on your Kubernetes cluster and communicates with the Formance Cloud to manage the resources in your private region.

## Setup

We can now install the Formance Operator on our cluster using Helm, and bind it to our private region. We will first create a values file, with the following keys:

<!-- agent, operator  -->

* `REGION_ID`
  * The private region identifier, as per given by fctl
* `REGION_SECRET`
  * The private region secret, as per given by fctl
* `REGION_URL`
  * The base URL you want to assign to your private region
  * The URL must begin with the http schema (eg: https://sandbox.formance.cloud)
  * Stacks created in this region will be assigned a subdomain in the form of `https://{organisationID}â€”{stackID}.{REGION_URL}`

:::info
Subdomains of `REGION_URL` will need to be publicly accessible in order to function properly with fctl and the Formance Cloud console.
:::

```yaml
# region.values.yaml
agent:
  enabled: true
  agent:
    id: "REGION_ID"
    baseUrl: "REGION_URL"
    authentication:
        clientID: "REGION_ID"
        clientSecret: "REGION_SECRET"
```

With this file in place, we can deploy our private region using Helm:

```bash
helm upgrade regions oci://ghcr.io/formancehq/helm/regions \
--version v2.0.0-rc.12 \
--namespace formance-system \
--values region.values.yaml
```
