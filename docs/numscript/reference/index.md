# Numscript reference

Numscript is a simple, yet powerful language for defining transactions in Formance Ledger. It is designed to be easy to read and write, while still being expressive enough to handle a wide range of financial transactions.

This section of the documentation provides a comprehensive reference for the Numscript language. If you're new to Numscript, you might want to start with the [Numscript introduction](../../ledger/get-started/hello-world/index.mdx) to get a feel for how it works.
