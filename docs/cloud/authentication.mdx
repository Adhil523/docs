## Authentication types

Formance Cloud exposes the same authentication types as Formance Stack. You can use the same authentication types in your Formance Cloud application as you would in a locally hosted Formance Stack, as described in the [Formance Stack Authentication](/stack/authentication) documentation.

In addition to those authentication types, Formance Cloud also supports the following methods.

## Personal authentication

To authorize API calls from the command line in a non-production environment, you can to generate a personal token. Personal tokens are only valid for use in sandbox environments, and expire after 60 minutes.

<CloudToken />

This saves the personal token into an environment variable called `FORMANCE_TOKEN` that we can use in further command lines. We can check the contents of the envronment variable to be sure that we have a valid token like this:

```shell
echo $FORMANCE_TOKEN
```

You should see a very long string of random characters that looks like this:

If you see something else, such as an error message, make sure you have a sandbox environment set up first.
