Formance is a programmable financial ledger that provides a foundation for money-moving applications. The ledger provides atomic multi-postings transactions and is programmable in [Numscript](doc:machine-instructions), a built-in language dedicated to money movements. It will shine for apps that require a lot of custom, money-moving code, e.g:

* E-commerce with complex payments flows, payments splitting, such as marketplaces
* Company-issued currencies systems, e.g. Twitch Bits
* In-game currencies, inventories and trading systems, e.g. Fortnite V-Bucks
* Payment gateways using non-standard assets, e.g. learning credits
* Local currencies and complementary finance
