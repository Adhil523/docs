To ease the installation of Formance Stack on AWS, we provide a full example of a deployment on Amazon Web Services that you can use to deploy the stack on your AWS account.

You can find the Terraform code on [GitHub](https://github.com/formancehq/stack-terraform-aws-example).

<Warning/>

## Prerequisites

To install Formance Stack on AWS, you need to have:
- An AWS account
- A MongoDB Atlas account

## Installation

Clone the repository and simply run:

```bash
terraform init
terraform apply
```

It will install all the components on ECS, a PostgreSQL database on RDS, a MongoDB database on MongoDB Atlas, a MSK instance, an OpenSearch instance and all the basics like Security Groups, Cloudwatch and ALB.
