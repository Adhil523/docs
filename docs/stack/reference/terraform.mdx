import Warning from '../partials/installation/_complexity_warning.mdx';

To provide a quick way to get started with the Formance Stack on AWS, we provide here an example of an ECS-based deployment with Terraform provisioning.

<Warning/>

## Prerequisites

To use this Terraform template, you just need to have:

* Terraform installed on your machine
* an AWS account ready to be used

## Installation

The Terraform template is distributed as this Github [repository](https://github.com/formancehq/stack-terraform-aws-example). Clone the repo to your machine, and simply run:

```bash
terraform init
terraform apply
```

Terraform will then proceed to provision the following:

* an ECS cluster
* a PostgreSQL RDS database
* an MSK instance
* an OpenSearch instance

Along with all the underlying basics like Security Groups, Cloudwatch and ALB resources. It will then deploy the Formance Stack services on top of this newly created infrastructure.


## Infrastructure upgrade

To upgrade the provisioned infrastructure, you can simply run in the repo directory:

```bash
git pull origin main
terraform apply
```

:::caution
This will upgrade **both** the infrastructure and the Formance Stack services. If you want to upgrade only the infrastructure, you can refer to the section below to run specific versions of the Formance Stack services.

## Running specific services versions

This repo is provisionned with pre-defined versions of the Formance Stack services. If you want to run a specific version of a service, you can simply edit the [task definition](https://github.com/formancehq/stack-terraform-aws-example/tree/main/task-definitions) of the service for which you want to specify the version.
