# Installation

Interested in trying Formance Stack out? You can install it on your local machine first.

Formance Stack is, as you'd expect, available for Linux, macOS, and Windows.

We also provide Docker images for production environments. You can learn more about all the different ways of installing Formance Stack in the [reference documentation](/Stack/operations/installation).

## macOS & Linux
<HomebrewInstall />

## Windows

[Download the pre-compiled binary ` fctl_x.y.z_Windows-64bit.zip`](https://github.com/formancehq/Stack/releases) from GitHub (where `x.y.z` is the version number). Unzip the file, and place `fctl.exe` somewhere convenient such as `C:\Program Files`.

:::info
Consider renaming the executable `fctl` (without the `.exe` suffix) to make it easier to type, and so the example commands in the rest of the tutorial will work without having to edit them.

## Troubleshooting

You can check that Formance CLI was installed correctly by trying the following command:

```shell
fctl version
```

You should see something like

```
Version | 0.5.0
Date    | 2022-11-28T09:40:15Z
Commit  | 0de953f
```

If you don't, then recheck the steps above, or [reach out to us](oss/Stack/help) to ask for help.
