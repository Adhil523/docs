description: Setup the Formance SDK in you Golang project.

## Create a new project

Create a new project with the following command:

```bash
mkdir formance-go-demo
cd formance-go-demo
go mod init example/formance-go-demo
```

## Install the Formance SDK

Install the Formance SDK with the following command:

```bash
go get github.com/formancehq/formance-sdk-go/v2
go get golang.org/x/oauth2/clientcredentials
```

:::info
The Formance API relies on OAuth 2.0 for authentication. 

For more information, see [OAuth 2.0](https://oauth.net/2/).
:::

:::danger
In this demo, we will setup the Formance SDK with the client credentials grant type,  which requires a client ID and client secret. These are sensitive credentials that should not be exposed to the public.

If you're integrating the Formance SDK in a client-side application, you should should use an OAuth 2.0 flow that does not expose the client secret, such as the [authorization code grant](https://oauth.net/2/grant-types/authorization-code/).

## Hello world from the Formance Ledger

Create a new file called `main.go` with the following content:

```go
package main

import (
  "context"
  "github.com/formancehq/formance-sdk-go/v2"
  "golang.org/x/oauth2/clientcredentials"
  "log"
)

const FORMANCE_ENDPOINT = "https://xxxxxxxxxx-xxxx.sandbox.formance.cloud"
const TOKEN_ENDPOINT = FORMANCE_ENDPOINT + "/api/auth/oauth/token"

func main() {
  config := clientcredentials.Config{
    ClientID:     "6a936dfe-xxxx-yyyy-zzzz-9019a1e9b9e3",
    ClientSecret: "20bd58c4-xxxx-yyyy-zzzz-dc05258bc959",
    TokenURL:     TOKEN_ENDPOINT,
  }

  ctx := context.Background()
  httpClient := config.Client(ctx)

  formance := v2.New(
    v2.WithServerURL(FORMANCE_ENDPOINT),
    v2.WithClient(httpClient),
  )

  info, err := formance.Ledger.GetInfo(ctx)

  if err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
  }

  println(info.ConfigInfoResponse.GetData().Version)
}
```
:::info
You'll need the API endpoint and the credentials created during the [SDK's Getting Started](./index.mdx) guide. If you don't have them, you can create them by following the guide.
:::

## Run the project

Run the project with the following command:

```bash
go run main.go
```

You should see the version of the Formance Ledger printed to the console, for example:

```bash
2.0.0-rc.13
```
